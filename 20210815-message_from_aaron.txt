hi guys

this is an important message

it is 8/15/2021, 12:15 in the noon, and I am sitting
in the passenger seat of my van waiting for my laundry
to finish.

My laundry is done. Goodbye.

p.s.
really this is just a test of adding a link to a .txt
file which I have already done, but I'm doing it again.
